## Data Approaches for Auto Manufacturing 

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
#### Nissan Automobile Sales Forecast Model ####

#### Set Up Work Directory Enviornment ####


Car_Sales <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttownsley/Research-Methods-Automotive/master/Data%20Sets/Car%20Sales/Car_sales.csv')



```

```{r cars sales, echo=FALSE}
### Exploratory Analysis ###

## creates time series object from data sets ## see https://otexts.com/fpp2/ts-objects.html

timeSA <- ts(totalsa, frequency = 12,  start = c(1976, 1))
plot(timeSA)
